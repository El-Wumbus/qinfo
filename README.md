# qinfo

A Linux system info program. Fetches system info and displays it.  

## Feature Set

* Show CPU model name, model number, cores, threads, and family.
* Show Total RAM and RAM usage
* Show Distro Name
* Show kernel name
* Filesystem Birthdate
* Show Hostname
* Show formatted uptime
* Runtime ini configuration parsing (using [inih](https://github.com/benhoyt/inih))

## How to install

To get the source code of this software you'll need the `git` version control software.
You probably already have it installed, you can check `git --version`.
If you get an error message then you must install `git` from your distro's repositories.

For the installation of this software a C compiler is required. Your distro already has one installed, it's probably `gcc`.
If not, then you need to install `gcc` (or have another compiler symlinked to it) You can check with `gcc --version`. If you get an error message then you must install
`gcc` from your distro's repositories.

You'll also need `make`, you likely already have this installed. You can check with `make --version`.
If you get an error message then you must install `make` from your distro's repositories.

This program is built with `glibc` in mind. If you use a different C library it may not function as expected.
This does not mean it doesn't work with other C libraries, this means i haven't confirmed functionality with
all the C libraries out there. Ensure you're using `glibc` before complaining about broken software.

Now that we have all the dependencies present we can compile the project. The following instructions assume the bash shell, though these instructions will work with the *vast* majority of linux shells (everything you're likely to use).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/El-Wumbus/qinfo.git
cd qinfo
sudo make install
```

If using Arch Linux you can Compile with pkgbuild to manage the package with pacman.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/El-Wumbus/qinfo.git
cd qinfo/archpkg
makepkg -si
```

## Usage

```bash
$ qinfo
CPU:            AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core Processor (6 cores, 12 threads)
RAM:            10.24/31.27 GB
OS:             Arch Linux (Linux)
Motherboard:    B550 GAMING X V2 (Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.)
Hostname:       Aidan-PC
ROOTFS BIRTH:   5/14/2022
Uptime:         1 days 14 hours 48 minutes 26 seconds
```

Anything printed here is configurable at `$HOME/.config/.qinfo.conf`. An example configuration looks like this:

```ini
[Display]
DISPLAY_CPU_INFO = true ; Display cpu name and core/thread info
DISPLAY_EXTRA_CPU_INFO = false ; Display extra cpu info
DISPLAY_MEMORY_INFO = true ; Display memory capacity and usage ratio
DISPLAY_HOSTNAME = true ; Display the computer's hostname
DISPLAY_UPTIME = true ; Display the system uptime
DISPLAY_OPERATING_SYSTEM = true ; Display the operating system name
DISPLAY_KERNEL_VERSION = true ; Only supported properly on unix-like operating systems
DISPLAY_ROOTFS_BIRTHDAY = true ; Display the rootfs birthday
DISPLAY_MOTHERBOARD_INFO = true ; Display motherboard info
DISPLAY_LOGO = true ; Will only apply if your os is detected and is supported.

[Color]
; Availible Color Options:
; - black
; - red
; - green

; - none

IDCOLOR = bold cyan ; Color for the id column
TXTCOLOR = none ; Color for the text column
LOGOCOLOR = red ; Color for the logo

[Extra]
USE_GIGABYTES = true ; Measure memory in gigabytes instead of kilobytes
DISPLAY_DATES = MDY ; supported formats are YMD (YYYY/MM/DD) and MDY(MM/DD/YYYY).

```

If no configuration is found then this notice will appear above the defualt output: `$HOME/.config/.qinfo.conf' not found, not loading configuration`.

The output with the above configuration looks like this:
